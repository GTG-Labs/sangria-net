# Backend CLAUDE.md

Go orchestration API. Module: `sangria/backend`. Framework: Fiber v3. Database: PostgreSQL via pgx.

## Commands

```bash
go build ./...          # Build (check for compile errors)
go build -o out         # Build production binary (Railway uses this)
go run .                # Run locally (loads .env via godotenv)
go vet ./...            # Static analysis
```

No test suite exists yet. No linter is configured.

## Architecture

Routes are organized by auth type in `routes/`:
- `public.go` — `GET /` health check
- `jwt.go` — `/internal/*` (WorkOS JWT) + `/webhooks/workos` + `/accept-invitation`
- `apikey.go` — `/v1/*` (merchant API key auth for SDK settlement)
- `admin.go` — `/admin/*` (WorkOS JWT + admins table)

Handler packages by auth context:
- `auth/` — user/org management, API key CRUD, middleware
- `adminHandlers/` — withdrawal approval, treasury, invitations, webhooks
- `merchantHandlers/` — payment settlement, transactions, merchant withdrawals

All database queries live in `dbEngine/`. Handlers call dbEngine functions, never raw SQL.

## Conventions

- Startup sequence in `main.go`: load env → setup WorkOS → load fee/withdrawal config → connect DB → ensure system accounts → register routes → listen
- API key format lives in `auth/merchantKeys.go` — use the helpers there, don't hand-roll parsing
- All handler functions return `fiber.Handler` (closure over `*pgxpool.Pool`)
- Organization context resolved via `ResolveOrganizationContext()` helper — checks `?org_id=` param, falls back to single membership or personal org
- Facilitator helpers split by idempotency: `doFacilitatorRequestIdempotent` retries on transient failures (use for `Verify`), `doFacilitatorRequestOnce` makes a single attempt (use for `Settle`). Do not retry `Settle` at the HTTP layer — see root CLAUDE.md § Non-Negotiable Principles for why.
